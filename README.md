## What is Granted?

Granted is a command line interface (CLI) application which simplifies access to cloud roles and allows multiple cloud accounts to be opened in your web browser simultaneously. The goals of Granted are:

- Provide a fast experience around finding and assuming roles

- Leverage native browser functionality to allow multiple accounts to be accessed at once

- Encrypt cached credentials to avoid plaintext SSO tokens being saved on disk

## What does Granted work with?

Granted supports MacOS, Linux, and Windows. Our Windows support is less extensively tested than other platforms so if you run into any problems please [let us know](https://join.slack.com/t/commonfatecommunity/shared_invite/zt-q4m96ypu-_gYlRWD3k5rIsaSsqP7QMg).

Currently Granted supports accessing roles in AWS. If you'd like to see support for another cloud provider please [open an issue](https://github.com/common-fate/granted/issues/new)!
